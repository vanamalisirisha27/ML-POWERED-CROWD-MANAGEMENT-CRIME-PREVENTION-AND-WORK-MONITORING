# ML POWERED CROWD MANAGEMENT, CRIME PREVENTION, AND WORK MONITORING

## Introduction

This project aims to redefine urban security and public safety by integrating machine learning (ML) technologies with Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) networks. It addresses the limitations of traditional surveillance methods and leverages cutting-edge ML techniques to enhance security and operational efficiency.

## Features

- Real-time video analysis using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) algorithm for detecting suspicious activities, anomalies, and crowd congestion.
- Face detection and alignment using RetinaFace.
- Accurate face recognition powered by ResNet50.
- Integration of ML-generated insights with conventional surveillance techniques for improved public safety and law enforcement efficiency.
- Streamlined operational processes and advanced monitoring capabilities.
